Modern processors use pipelined architecture to increase instruction throughput by dividing the execution of instructions into several stages. However, to achieve maximum performance, the pipeline stages need to be fully filled, and empty stages can be caused by various factors, such as the misprediction of dynamic control-flow caused by conditional branch instructions and the delay caused by waiting for data to arrive from external memory. To mitigate these issues, modern architectures can be limited by control-flow delays and data dependency issues. To address these concerns, processors have introduced techniques such as branch prediction, cache memory, and out-of-order execution.

The advantage of branch prediction is that it can significantly reduce the delay caused by conditional branch instructions, resulting in higher instruction throughput and improved performance. However, branch prediction is not always accurate, and incorrect predictions can lead to wasted processing cycles and decreased performance. Additionally, predicting the correct branch path requires analysis of the program's control-flow, which can be a complex and computationally expensive task. As a result, improving the accuracy of branch prediction is an ongoing challenge for modern processor designers. Cache memory reduces the impact of loading data from external memory, but cache misses can lead to delays and empty pipeline stages. In addition, finding independent instructions is a challenging problem, and it is done by selecting candidate instructions in an instruction window, which is a pool of fetched instructions. This task requires data dependency analysis on a chip, which can limit the scope of the instruction window. Out-of-order execution is another technique used by modern processors to maintain performance and overcome the impact of control-flow delays caused by branch misprediction. This technique allows the processor to execute instructions out-of-order that maximize the utilization of pipeline stages and computational resources, even if the instructions are not in the original program order. By analyzing the dependencies among instructions and rearranging their execution, the processor can fully fill pipeline stages and maintain a higher level of instruction throughput.

While these techniques have improved performance, they also present ongoing challenges in terms of accuracy, scalability, and power efficiency. As technology markets continue to evolve at a rapid pace, modern processors have become increasingly important for meeting the demands of high-performance and power-efficient computing. However, even with advanced pipelined architectures, processors can still face issues such as branch misprediction and delays caused by loading data from external memory. In addition, there is a growing demand for computing systems that can meet the needs of a wide range of applications. Given the trends and these challenges, there is a need for innovative solutions that can balance the performance, flexibility, and cost considerations in designing computing systems. In this context, the coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) architecture and compiler have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional CPU and GPU-based systems. By offering customizable and efficient hardware and software components, CGRAs can be tailored to meet specific application requirements and provide a flexible platform for future adaptation. CGRA architectures and compilers allow developers to customize and optimize both the hardware and software components of a computing system, providing a high degree of performance and efficiency for specific application domains. However, developing CGRA-based systems can be challenging and expensive, requiring specialized hardware and software expertise, as well as complex design and manufacturing processes.

Our proposal aims to address these challenges by exploring new approaches to developing a general-purpose CGRA architecture and compiler that can simplify the design and implementation process, while also providing the flexibility and adaptability required to meet the changing requirements of the market. The goal of this proposal is to create an architecture and compiler that are well-suited for a wide range of applications and can be easily customized and adapted to meet specific requirements. Using RISC philosophy for both the architecture and compiler can simplify the design and implementation of both components and can help ensure that they are well-suited for a wide range of applications. Using an existing common compiler frontend can simplify the development process; since it leverages existing infrastructure and tools to generate the necessary IR code for the CGRA architecture. The CGRA architecture can offer advantages in terms of power efficiency and design flexibility, which can be important for certain types of applications.
