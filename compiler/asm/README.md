# Assembler for Electron Nest

Electron Nest (EN) is CGRA-"like" microarchitecture (but very different from those arch types).
EN does not needs adjustment of path length at place and route work in compilation, because the architecture supports synchronization for operands.
Thus, the data-flow graph can be mapped on the EN's array without such the huge efforts.
